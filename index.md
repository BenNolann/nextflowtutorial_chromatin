# DECODE Data Processing Lesson

This lesson is attributed to the [Holland Computing Center Nextflow Workshop](https://hcc.unl.edu/nextflow-2024-workshop-links). The lesson from HCC is much longer than what we will be learning today, and if you would like to learn more about Nextflow please visit their site linked above.
